    With movie theaters still on lockdown, drive-ins
    have been making a resurgence across the country,
    including the Hudson Valley. Story Screen drive-in
    launched in Beacon, New York, shows a range of movies
    from newer releases like “Mad Max: Fury Road” to family
    classics such as “The Goonies.” Up to 35 cars can park
    to watch the flicks in the open-air forum that opened
    earlier this year, after the 91-year-old Beacon Theater
    nearby was restored in 2019. There’s a special lineup
    of Halloween films, too. 
    Cost of admission is $10 per adult and $8 per child.
